Project: Personal Diary UI
Course: L&T Front End UI/UX Development

Description:
This project is a simple, static webpage designed to look like a personal diary or journal. It fulfills the requirement of creating a notebook-themed UI.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3

Design Choices:
- Font: I used [Amatic SC] from Google Fonts to give the text a handwritten feel.
- Background: A subtle paper texture was used for the background to mimic a real notebook.
- Layout: The layout uses a main container with a box-shadow to look like a book, and each entry is a separate article/card.
